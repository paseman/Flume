Flume water Interface
Flume water is a device that lets you monitor your water usage by strapping a wif-enabled device to your water meter, and putting a wireless hub in your home.
In addition to a web-based monitoring tool (with alerts) It comes with an API in several languages, including python.
Although the API is straightforward, this script resolves several points that were unclear to me.
It uses the Flume API to query the device and plot data in a log/linear (y-axis) and arbitrarily zoomable x-axis.
Log is useful if you want to see developing leaks over time.
Thanks to Flume support for their help.
